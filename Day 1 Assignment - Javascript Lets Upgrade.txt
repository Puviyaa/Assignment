1. Difference between var and let?

var can be declared in global and it won't be limited. It is used as global scope.
let can be declared within a scope and it is limited. It is used as limited scope.

var is the most preferrable one as it can be used globally.

2. Why null, array printed as object type in console?

Null is primitive data type. Since it is assigning reference to an object , it is showing as object type.
An array is a derived data type and all derived data types will be a object type.
